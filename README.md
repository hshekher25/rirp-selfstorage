## 📖 Configuration

### Banking System Setup
The script supports two modes depending on your banking system:

#### For Banking Systems with Static Identifiers (IBAN, Account Numbers)
```lua
Banking = {
    hasStaticIdentifiers = true,
    noIdentifierMessage = 'Your banking system does not support automatic payments'
}
```

#### For Banking Systems without Static Identifiers
```lua
Banking = {
    hasStaticIdentifiers = false,
    noIdentifierMessage = 'Your banking system does not support automatic payments'
}
```

When `hasStaticIdentifiers = false`:
- Auto-renewal features are disabled
- Bank account linking is hidden
- Only manual payments are available
- Grace period and deletion systems still work

### Banking Functions
Edit the banking functions in `server/main.lua` (lines 14-37):

```lua
-- Example Integration with RxBanking
Banking.GetPlayerAccount = function(identifier)
    local accountData = exports['RxBanking']:GetPlayerPersonalAccount(identifier)
    if type(accountData) == "table" then
        return accountData.iban
    elseif type(accountData) == "string" then
        return accountData
    end
    return nil
end

Banking.RemoveAccountMoney = function(accountId, amount, unitId)
    return exports['RxBanking']:RemoveAccountMoney(
        accountId, 
        amount, 
        'payment', 
        locale('storage_unit_autorenewal', { id = unitId }), 
        nil
    )
end
```
